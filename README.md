I. In the directory of src/3DSc,  we have implemented how to model the scattered surface waves.

The scattering problem is studied of an inclusion, embedded in a layered, traction-free, elastic half-space with the help of a domain-type integral-equation formulation. This problem is characteristic for near-surface scattering problems occurring in exploration seismology. The singular character of the Green's function is taken into account in an accurate and efficient manner using an asymptotic description of itsnear-field behaviour. The numerical results show good qualitative agreement with experimental scale-model data.

The codes were implemented and developed during my PhD at TUDELFT, The Netherlands. \
The codes are written in Fortran, C with MPI. Matlab was used to visualize the output data (see in the directory of pictures).

II. In the directory of src/3DPd, we have developed a new iterative method for solving 2D/3D Helmholtz problem with preconditioned with the parallel implementation of the algorithm using MPI.
The codes were implemented and developed during my Postdoc at the Numerical Analysis, TUDELFT, The Netherlands. \
The codes are written in Fortran, C with MPI. Matlab was used to visualize the output data (see in the directory of pictures).
