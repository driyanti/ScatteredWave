Modeling of scattered surface waves

The scattering problem is studied of an inclusion, embedded in a layered, traction-free, elastic half-space with the help of a domain-type integral-equation formulation. This problem is characteristic for near-surface scattering problems occurring in exploration seismology. The singular character of the Green's function is taken into account in an accurate and efficient manner using an asymptotic description of its near-field behaviour. The numerical results show good qualitative agreement with experimental scale-model data.

The codes were implemented and developed during my PhD at TUDELFT, The Netherlands.\
The codes are written in Fortran, C with MPI. Matlab was used to visualize the output data (see in the directory of pictures).
